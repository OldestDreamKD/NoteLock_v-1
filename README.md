This was a project given to me by Innovate team while I was working as an intern at their virtual internship.

This is a static app intended to be full web app with mongodb intergration but due to certain constarins it was not feasable.
This site has some pre-build inputs that are displayed and you cannot persist the new notes/passwords you create.

I intend to add encryption along with database retrival during user authentication as you can see on my source code folder, but I couldn't.

I would really appreciate anyone's feedback and know that I will try to consistently improve this web app.

Live site: https://notelock-v-1.onrender.com/
This was deployed on Render's free service so please be paitent as it will take a frew minutes to load/boot up the server. 

Thank you for reading this far!!,
